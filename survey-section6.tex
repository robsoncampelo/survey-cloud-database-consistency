In this survey, we have reviewed several methods 
%related to the consistency property in distributed
{\al  proposed in the literature} to ensure consistency in distributed cloud data storage systems (Table~2). 
%The ensuring of consistency in replicated databases reprsents an important study area and a challenge, in the sense that a storage system must to provide a consistent state in all replicas, 
Ensuring consistency in replicated databases is an important research topic that offers many challenges in the sense that such systems must provide a consistent state in all replicas, despite the occurrence of concurrent transactions. In other words, it must be provided a suite of strategies for data update and propagation in order to guarantee that if one copy is updated, all the other ones must be updated as well. 
%The proposed taxonomy will provide researcher and developer the ideas and challenges on this area.
The proposed taxonomy presented 
here provides researchers and developers with a framework to better understand the current main ideas and challenges in this area.

%As we presented in the surveyed works, there are significant efforts. However, while some of the challenges have been addressed, there are some open issues. We highlight that some consistency methods assume entirely specific contexts whose results might not be generalized. In addition, few works address the elasticity property in the context of how to deal with consistency requirements in large scale systems, what let us to consider there are still gaps to be exploited in other approaches.
As presented in the surveyed works, there have been significant efforts in the area. {\al However, although some challenges have been addressed, there are still many open issues.} For instance, despite existing solutions that aim at supporting gen\-eral-purpose applications~\cite{BrandenburgerCK15,esteves2012quality,liu2014consistency,MukundanML12}, we highlight that some consistency methods consider very specific contexts~\cite{balegas2015putting,Chen:2014,chihoub2012harmony,cooper2008pnuts,Corbett:2013,Du2013,sivasubramanian2012amazon,Terry:2013}. Moreover, very few of the proposed solutions~\cite{Chen:2014,chihoub2012harmony,sivasubramanian2012amazon} address the elasticity property when dealing with consistency requirements in large scale cloud data storage systems, which allows us to say that there are still open issues to be exploited by others. %approaches.
